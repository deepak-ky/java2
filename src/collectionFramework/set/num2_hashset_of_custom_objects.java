         * Understanding equals() and hashCode() in HashSet
         *
         * HashSet uses a combination of hashCode() and equals() to determine object uniqueness:
         *
         * 1. hashCode() is used to locate the correct bucket in the hash table.
         * 2. equals() is used to check if an object in the same bucket is "equal" to the new one.
         *
         * To prevent duplicates, both these methods must behave consistently:
         * - If two objects are logically equal (as per equals()), they must also return the same hashCode().
         * - If this contract is broken, unexpected duplicates can appear in the set.
         *
         * üîç Case 1: equals() and hashCode() are NOT overridden
         * - Java uses the default implementations from Object class:
         *     - hashCode(): returns a value based on memory address
         *     - equals(): compares object references (i.e., this == other)
         * - So even if two Student objects have the same rollNo and name, they are treated as different if they are separate objects.
         * - Result: Both objects are added to the HashSet ‚Äî duplicate not detected.
         *
         * üîç Case 2: ONLY hashCode() is overridden, but equals() is NOT
         * - Two objects with the same rollNo can return the same hashCode and go to the same bucket.
         * - However, since equals() is not overridden, it still compares memory references (this == other) ‚Üí returns false.
         * - Result: Even though they are in the same bucket, they are still treated as different and both are added.
         *
         * ‚úÖ Conclusion:
         * - Overriding only one of hashCode() or equals() is not enough.
         * - You must override both, and ensure they are consistent:
         *     - If equals() returns true, then hashCode() must return the same value.
         *     - If equals() returns false, the hashCode values may or may not be the same.
         * - This ensures that logically equal objects are detected correctly and duplicates are avoided.
